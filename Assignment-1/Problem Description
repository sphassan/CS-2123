(100 pts) Write a program to create a pgm file with 8x8 checkerboard pattern. Image dimensions will
be 800x800 pixels and each black and white cell will be 100x100 pixels. Consider the following figure
for details. In the figure B denotes black cells and W denotes white cells.
<Figure omitted>
PGM file format is as follows
P2
Width Height
MaxGray
Data
Width and height are width and height of the image. MaxGray is the maximum gray value. This
will be 255 in our case. Data is grayscale pixel values (0 for black, 255 for white) separated by space.
When your program produces the pgm files, you can use gpicview or gimp to open pgm fies on machines running Linux. Use _pgm extension for your files.
Sample pgm file is given below
P2
